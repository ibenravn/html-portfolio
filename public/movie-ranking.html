<br>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. You've Got Mail</h3>
<p> Combines my love of romance, books and autumn all in one movie.</p>

<br>
<h3>2. The Lion King</h3>
<p>This has been my favourite since I was a child - it still gets me crying my eyes out.
</p>

<br>
<h3>3. Call Me By Your Name</h3>
<p>This movie is so beautiful and raw. Full of emotion and insecurities, coming of age and figuring yourself, and the world, out.</p>
